# daily_korean
The goal of this project is to manage vocabulary lists and either print or send an email with the vocabulary I must learn for the day.

The code is based on stuff I read in "Automate the boring stuff with Python", by A. Sweigart.

Simple and useful script.

# To-do list
- Make an exec file or something similar (using a batch file so far)
- Send an email without getting banned from Google (just printing so far)
